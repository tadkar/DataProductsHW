The app is a simple calculator that predicts the fuel economy for a car given only the horsepower of the engine and the type of transmission (manual or automatic).

In the left hand side bar, enter the values of the engine horsepower, check the radio button for the type of transmission.
Finally, enter the price of a gallon of gasoline.

The main panel will compute and report the predicted fuel economy of your car.

Below this, the program print a graph of the cost of fuel required to drive various distances. The graph is reactive and should update when any of the input values are changed.
